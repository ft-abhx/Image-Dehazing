# Image-Dehazing using Contextual Regularization 

Image dehazing is a well-known ill-posed problem, which usually requires some image priors to make the problem well-posed. Single image dehazing aims to estimate a haze-free image
from a hazy image. It is a classical image processing problem, which has been an active research topic in the vision and graphics communities within the last decade. 

## Method
An efficient regularization method to remove haze from a single input image. This method benefits much from an exploration of the inherent boundary constraint on the transmission
function.
This constraint, combined with a weighted L1âˆ’norm based contextual regularization, is modeled into an optimization problem to estimate the unknown scene transmission.
A quite efficient algorithm based on variable splitting is also presented to solve the problem. This method requires only a few general assumptions and can restore a high-quality haze-free image with faithful colors and fine image details.
