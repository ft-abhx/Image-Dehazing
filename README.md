# Image-Dehazing using Contextual Regularization 

Image dehazing is a well-known ill-posed problem, which usually requires some image priors to make the problem well-posed. Single image dehazing aims to estimate a haze-free image
from a hazy image. It is a classical image processing problem, which has been an active research topic in the vision and graphics communities within the last decade.
